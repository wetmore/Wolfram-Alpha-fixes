Wolfram Alpha Fixes
===================

Wolfram Alpha recently added a paid membership option, and added a bunch of cool new features for people who sign up. However, they also made a few previously free options accessible only to paying members - most annoyingly, the ability to copy plaintext representations of WA output. 

This userscript removes that restriction. Over time I'll add any other small fixes to make Wolfram Alpha more convenient.

To install, simply drag the file into Chrome, or install something like Greasemonkey for Firefox.
